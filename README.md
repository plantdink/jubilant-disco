# The Portfolio Project

So you have finished a software development bootcamp......you have "learnt" all of these new skills & languages & frameworks & programs & concepts.....what happens next?

If you are like me, you start looking for a job. To get one, you need to demonstrate your skills, maybe start to extend yourself by using a popular language/framework......

How do you do that? You do a project, possibly a portfolio site, like this one.

## Getting Started

These [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project was created using React Native and React Router. Start your own react project from scratch using the following command:

```js
create-react-app
```

### Further Development

This project is very much live and will be continually developed when I can bring myself to wrestle more with React.

Feel free to fork a copy of the repository to create a version of your own. This has been a very big learning experience for me. Whilst I am still not the greatest fan of React, I acknowledge its appeal and am happy to continue developing my skills with it.

## Deployment

This deployment method is via the command line interface and assumes you have already installed and authorised the netlify CLI tools.

To install CLI tools:
```js
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

To authorise CLI tools:
```js
cd test-netlify-deployment
netlify deploy
```

To deploy application to production, run the following:
```js
npm run build

netlify deploy
```

If everything looks ok when you check the draft URL, then run:
```js
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Built With
