        I am a creative, hard-working problem solver. I love to learn and enjoy applying that knowledge practically in real world situations that make life easier for the end user. Since the Commodore C64 I have had a fascination with computers and what makes them tick.
      <br/>
        After a few career detours I am now actively pursuing software engineering and development full-time. My previous career experience allows me to offer a unique insight, and a highly practical end-user perspective to my development work. Small, close-knit team environments that contribute to the big picture is where I excel and I have a proven track record of high performance in the most demanding of roles and situations.
