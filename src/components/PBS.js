            Since the Commodore C64 I have had a fascination with computers and
            what makes them work. I am a creative, hard-working problem solver.
            I love to learn and enjoy applying that knowledge in a practical way
            to make life easier for other people.

            As a career-changer I am actively pursuing
            cloud-focused software development roles. My previous experience
            allows me to offer unique insight and a highly practical
            perspective. Small, close-knit team environments that contribute to
            the big picture are where I excel and I have a proven record of high
            performance in the most demanding of roles and situations.
